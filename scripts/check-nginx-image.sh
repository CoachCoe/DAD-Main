# check-nginx-image.sh — build the ECS ingress image (deploy/nginx/Dockerfile) and check it.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-nginx-image.sh
#
# docker-compose.prod.yml bind-mounts deploy/nginx into the stock nginx image;
# scripts/check-ingress.sh checks that path. Fargate cannot bind-mount, so ECS runs the
# image built here instead. This checks the differences, with a throwaway certificate:
#   - the base image is exactly the one Compose pins;
#   - the certificate and key arrive from the environment (ECS secrets) and are written
#     0600 for uid 101;
#   - the Docker-only resolver is gone and `web` is a static upstream;
#   - nginx starts as uid 101, passes `nginx -t`, and answers /health on 127.0.0.1:8081;
#   - a half-configured certificate is refused.
# `web` must resolve when nginx starts; on ECS, Service Connect provides it. Here an
# --add-host entry stands in for it.
