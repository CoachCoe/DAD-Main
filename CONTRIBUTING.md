# Contributing

Use `dev` for the current R1 work. Keep commits focused; do not rewrite shared history.
Read [the product contract](docs/donor-domain.md) before changing financial behavior.

Go owns backend behavior, TypeScript owns the web application, and SQL owns persistence.
Keep recipient workflows, AI, blockchain, and aid disbursement outside this release.
Do not add dependencies without a concrete need. Do not commit generated build output,
credentials, or editor files. Working and process notes (session logs, investigation
reports, plans, scratch docs) are never tracked: keep them under the git-ignored
`docs/requirements/` directory. Tracked `docs/` holds durable product documentation only —
architecture, operations, the product contract, and the like.

Follow the [README](README.md) setup, then run `make test`, `make lint`, and
`make test-browser-e2e`; after changing `deploy/`, `scripts/`, or a Dockerfile, also run
`make check-ingress smoke-ingress check-images`. CI runs the same `make` targets. Database integration tests use only the dedicated `donor_go`
database. They do not replace Stripe test-account acceptance or real-device checks.
Never weaken assertions, skip a failing test, or fabricate production facts to pass CI.

Change SQL sources and regenerate with `make generate`; never hand-edit generated query
files or `apps/web/lib/openapi.d.ts`; CI's `make check-generated` fails on drift. Change
`apps/donor-api/api/openapi.json` with any API shape and regenerate; web code names API
shapes through the generated types rather than declaring its own, and native apps
generate their clients from the same contract. Add a new forward migration for schema
changes, and declare a new table's privileges in `apps/donor-api/internal/dbroles` in the
same change ([database roles](docs/operations.md#database-roles)). Existing migration
checksums must remain stable. Review transaction boundaries,
authorization, idempotency, refund effects, and out-of-order provider events in every
financial change.

Read `apps/web/AGENTS.md` and the installed Next documentation before frontend changes.
Check mobile and desktop, keyboard interaction, loading/error/empty states, and safe retry
behavior. A cancelled network request is not proof that a payment command failed.

Keep documentation accurate. Report test limitations and external acceptance still
required. Never print donor data, tokens, passwords, keys, or provider response bodies in
logs, tests, screenshots, or pull requests.
