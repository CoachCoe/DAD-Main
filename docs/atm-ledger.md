# Durable ATM ledger

The active ledger runs at `https://impactgraph-atm-ledger.cocuyo.workers.dev`, backed
by the dedicated `impactgraph-atm-ledger-history` R2 bucket. Source lives in
`apps/atm-ledger`. Both branch workflows require the durable service and hold no Git
write permission. There is no Git fallback on an outage.

The original Git history is preserved by the annotated tag
`archive/atm-state-20261013`. Do not restore the old state branch as an operational
ledger; use verified archive recovery below.

## Storage and integrity

One SQLite-backed Cloudflare Durable Object coordinates this repository's ledger.
Its `events` table is append-only: SQLite triggers reject updates and deletes.
Every event includes its version, previous event hash, before/after ledger digests,
authenticated actor and execution, request digest, and a finding/receipt delta.
The current ledger is a derived projection, compatible with the pinned ATM v1 format.

Each event is also written to a dedicated private R2 bucket under two indexes:
`events/` in ascending version order for recovery, and `history/` in descending order
for independent head checks. Both contain the same hash-bound event envelope. Enable
indefinite bucket locks before migration. A committed event remains pending until both
archive copies are verified. Failed archival blocks acknowledgement and subsequent
reads; retries reuse the event rather than appending another receipt.

Every snapshot verifies the ledger digest, the archive head, and the archived head
event. A restored database behind the archive fails closed. Recovery replays bounded
batches from the ascending archive, validates the chain and projections, then records
an administrative recovery event. It never discards newer archive history.

Account administrators can still deploy new code, remove bucket locks, or delete
resources. This is an append-only application protocol with independent retained
copies, not protection against a compromised Cloudflare account administrator.
Restrict account access and deployment credentials accordingly.

## Access

There are no shared publisher or triage passwords. The Worker verifies GitHub's signed
OIDC tokens, issuer, audience, expiry, repository ID, owner ID, workflow path, event,
hosted-runner claim, and job environment. The audience is
`atm-ledger:github:CoachCoe/ImpactGraph`.

| Job environment | Allowed operations |
|---|---|
| `atm-ledger-reader` | Read the current ledger for validation |
| `atm-ledger-publisher` | Read and publish the pinned verifier's next ledger; no triage |
| `atm-ledger-admin` | Owner-initiated migration, audited triage, verified history export and recovery |

Administrative access additionally requires `workflow_dispatch` on `dev` and an
actor ID in the Worker's `ADMIN_ACTOR_IDS` allowlist. Actors are derived from the signed
token, never from request parameters. Initially only CoachCoe's immutable ID is allowed.
Protect workflow changes and Cloudflare deployments through normal repository and
account review. Existing branch protection is not changed by this migration.

Publication requires the exact version and digest read before candidate execution.
The pinned ATM publisher still verifies candidate, execution, evidence hash, artifact
receipt, finding recurrence and historical triage before submitting a change. The
service independently prevents receipt replacement, finding deletion, publisher triage,
execution substitution, stale updates, and conflicting retries. A concurrent triage
change blocks publication; rerun the full ATM validation instead of rebasing a verdict.

## Install, test and deploy

Requires Node 22.19+ or Node 24, npm, a Cloudflare account with Workers/Durable Objects
and R2 enabled, and permission to create a dedicated Worker and bucket. Wrangler is
pinned in the service lockfile; `jose` supplies JWT verification. The Cloudflare test
plugin executes integration tests in the Workers runtime, including real SQLite/R2.

```sh
cd apps/atm-ledger
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run lint
npm audit --audit-level=high
npm run build
npx wrangler whoami
# If required, authenticate interactively: npx wrangler login
```

Confirm the intended account before creating resources. Do not reuse an application
bucket, expose this bucket publicly, or configure lifecycle deletion. If multiple
accounts are available, set `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` to the intended account.

```sh
npx wrangler r2 bucket create impactgraph-atm-ledger-history
npx wrangler r2 bucket lock add impactgraph-atm-ledger-history immutable-ledger "" --retention-indefinite
npx wrangler r2 bucket lock list impactgraph-atm-ledger-history
npm run deploy
```

Keep the resulting HTTPS Worker origin; it is configuration, not a secret. Unauthenticated
requests must return 401. Configure the repository variable `ATM_LEDGER_URL` with that
origin, without a path. Create the three named GitHub environments above. Restrict the
admin environment to `dev`; protect environment administration and the actor allowlist.
An environment's protection rules may add human approval if the organization requires it.

## Initial migration

The initial import preserved all 22 committed ledger revisions through Git commit
`397aee9237f2266aeb223219686340a3e416c6af`: 19 execution receipts and two resolved
findings, each with its original audit record. The owner-authenticated import ran in
[Actions run 38488982545](https://github.com/CoachCoe/ImpactGraph/actions/runs/38488982545).
A separate [history export](https://github.com/CoachCoe/ImpactGraph/actions/runs/38489085019)
verified every event hash, previous hash, before/after digest, source commit anchor,
finding audit and receipt against every original Git revision. The source branch tip
was checked again before activation.

The service was deployed from the code committed in `6774ec3`, Cloudflare version
`936fa1c6-339b-4c53-a362-295be87ddaf1`. Both consumer workflows were updated with explicit
main-branch authorization. Publication was paused while legacy runs drained and the
import was verified. `ATM_LEDGER_URL` selects the service origin;
`ATM_LEDGER_BACKEND=paused` remains a maintenance switch that blocks acceptance.
Other backend values cannot enable a Git fallback in the final workflow.

The Git state branch can be removed only after both branches have passed complete
validation, encrypted evidence retention, durable publication and acceptance. Retain
the archive tag. Identical retries must leave each execution receipt present exactly
once. Any failed check requires investigation; never initialize an empty replacement.

Migration remains an administrator-only, one-time bootstrap for an empty namespace
with no retained archive. Repeating the original manifest is idempotent; a different
import is refused. Never use migration instead of recovery for an existing ledger.

## Audited triage

Review the retained encrypted evidence and write a private review note outside Git.
Then request owner-authenticated triage from the repository root:

```sh
node scripts/atm-ledger.mjs triage-request /private/path/review.txt FINDING_ID medium resolved
```

The client dispatches only the note's SHA-256 and classification; the note itself stays
private. Retain the note and relevant encrypted evidence. The service records the signed
GitHub actor and execution and appends an audit event. Passing tests do not silently
close a finding; a recurrence reopens it and retains its triage history.

Use `ledger_operation=history` for a verified paginated export. GitHub evidence artifacts
still expire after 30 days; the durable ledger/R2 event archive does not extend encrypted
evidence retention. Download needed evidence before expiry, as with the previous gate.

## Outages and recovery

Storage, issuer, integrity and concurrency errors fail acceptance. Investigate before
retrying; do not delete history, clear findings, change an eligible flag, or fall back
to the retired Git ledger. Identical HTTP publication retries are idempotent. Rerun all
ATM jobs after a failed validation/publication attempt.

If a point-in-time database restore leaves SQLite behind its archive, dispatch
`ledger_operation=recover`. Only the authorized admin workflow can do this. It replays
up to 10 missing archived events per request. Larger recoveries make durable progress
and return a retryable error until replay is complete; repeat the administrative job
if its bounded retries are exhausted. The final replay verifies the archive head and
records recovery without modifying original events or receipts.

Do not roll back Worker code to a revision that initializes a missing ledger or omits
the integrity checks. Preserve the Durable Object namespace and R2 bucket when rolling
back code. A contradictory archive or corrupted history requires operator investigation;
the recovery endpoint does not guess which conflicting record is correct.

Requests are bounded at 16 MiB, ledger projections at 1 MiB and individual events at
512 KiB (below SQLite row limits). Migration is bounded at
1,000 legacy revisions, and history exports at 100 events per page. The administrative
CLI bounds an interactive export at 100,000 events. Exceeding a bound blocks the operation
and requires an explicitly reviewed capacity change; it never returns a partial green verdict.


## Cost controls

The service limits authenticated operations to 1,000 per UTC day, new events to 200
per UTC day, and both retained R2 copies combined to 100 MiB. SQLite counters reserve
archive bytes in the event transaction; failed transactions and identical publication
retries do not reserve twice. Recovery accounts for restored events. Daily resets never
reset retained bytes. Exceeding a quota blocks acceptance, preserves history, and requires
operator review or a reviewed capacity change. Each archival/recovery pass handles ten
events so initial import can drain through bounded, idempotent retries.

An ingress limiter rejects excess traffic before JWT verification or storage work:
60 requests per minute per Cloudflare location using a service-wide key. This is an
approximate local abuse limit, not a global request or dollar cap. Invalid requests
still invoke the Worker. Start with Workers Free's provider-enforced limits; do not
upgrade the account to Paid as part of this migration. If Free cannot support the
verified workload, review the failure and pricing before any upgrade. On Free, the
platform's CPU limit applies; configuring a higher paid CPU limit is not required.

Configure account budget alerts at $1, $5 and $10 in Billing > Billable Usage. Alerts
are informational, may be delayed and exclude recurring plan fees; they are not a
spending cap. Quotas apply only to this application's activity, and retained objects
continue consuming storage after writes stop. Other applications share account free
allowances. R2 remains private and uses Standard storage. No automatic expiry deletes
the append-only history. Recheck account usage after import and the first billing cycle.
