        DAD brings donors and partner organizations together to support practical aid work. Each initiative is assembled
        with a partner and approved by the board. From launch, programs invite people to enrol in that work.
      </p>
      <h2>Giving</h2>
      <p>
        Give monthly on the web, without creating an account first. Giving suggests about a dollar a day, billed as
        $30/month. You can also choose $90, $150, or any amount up to $900/month. The monthly amount is what your card
        is charged.
      </p>
      <h2>Your circle</h2>
      <p>
        After giving, claim your account to share your personal link or show your referral code on your phone. A Link
        Referral begins with a shared link; an IRL Referral begins when someone scans your code. Your dashboard counts
        them separately, once a first gift completes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your circle includes only people you personally refer. Attributed dollars reflect money actually collected, less
        successful refunds.
      </p>
      <h2>Streaks and recognition</h2>
      <p>
        Successful monthly gifts keep your streak growing in local calendar days. A failed renewal has 7 days to recover
        before your active streak resets. Cancellation ends it at the first skipped renewal. Your historical best stays
        recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
        DAD launches on {launchDateLabel()}. A first gift completed by {foundingDeadlineLabel()} (New York time) earns a
        permanent Founding Donor badge.
      </p>
      <h2>Clear records, honest limits</h2>
      <p>
        DAD publishes spend as totals by category, never as individual transactions. Staff verify each figure against
        finance records before it is published.
      </p>
      <h2>Programs start at launch</h2>
      <p>
        This donor release does not enrol recipients or send money to them. Aid programs begin at launch. Partners can
        apply now; approved partners use the partner portal to manage their profile, initiatives, employee giving, and
        reports. Donor apps for iOS and Android are being developed separately.
