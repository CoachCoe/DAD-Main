-- R1 staff reporting (PRD §4 success metrics / docs/analytics.md).
--
-- Every metric here is computed from COMMITTED SERVER FACTS — gifts, billing
-- periods, refunds, and the donor metric projection — never from the browser
-- analytics_events stream, which docs/analytics.md marks deferred by product
-- agreement ("metrics requiring it must be marked unavailable, never displayed
-- as fabricated zeros"). The one browser-only metric (seven-day share rate) has
-- no query here; the service reports it unavailable.
--
-- Attribution is the FROZEN source on the donor's own projection row
-- (referrer_id / referral_kind, set at the earliest verified payment), not the
-- browser campaign parameters. DIRECT = no referrer. A donor's "first gift" is
-- the projection's first_gift_id, which references donor_gifts.stripe_object_id.
--
-- Reporting periods are half-open [start, end) on gift paid_at / period due_at,
-- in UTC. The caller supplies $1=start, $2=end; the service echoes the cutoff
-- and timezone alongside the numbers.

-- name: ReportFoundingDonors :one
-- Distinct donors whose permanent founding award was granted (projection
-- founding_awarded_at). A later refund/cancellation does not remove it. Scoped
-- to awards recorded in the period so the report is period-attributable.

-- name: ReportFirstGiftBySource :many
-- First-gift conversions grouped by frozen source (DIRECT/LINK/IRL). A "first
-- gift" is the gift the projection points at (first_gift_id); its paid_at must
-- fall in the period. gift mix (frequency) rides along so first-gift donor mix
-- is reported without confusing gifts with donors.
